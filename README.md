Simple project to use the PCF8591 Analog to Digital converter (driver based on the one from @davemckelvie)

Designed to be used with a Rainbow HAT. Reads the value from the analog input 3 and displays the raw value on the LCD Display and uses the LED Strip as a progress bar.

I am using this particular board based on the chip
